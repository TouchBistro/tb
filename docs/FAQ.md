## Issues with `node_modules`

(Last updated: 2019/05/24)

This is rare, but if a local, non-ECR service uses volumes, and a recent commit has made extensive changes to its `node_modules`, you may encounter issues when attempting to build that container again. For example, if you are seeing "module not found" errors after pulling extensive changes to a project, making the container fail to boot.

To improve performace, tb persists your service's `node_modules` to a Docker volume. This statefulness isn't always what we want, sometimes we just need a clean slate. Any node developer will reach for `rm -rf node_modules` eventually. Here is the tb equivalent.

To clear out _all_ volumes without deleting any Docker images, you can run:

```
docker-compose $(bin/compose_files) down --volumes
```

To remove individual volumes, use the `docker volume ls`, `docker volume rm` commands. Keep in mind you will also have to `docker container rm` the container using that volume, even if that container is not booted. Example:

```
$ docker volume rm tb_partners-etl-service-node_modules
Error response from daemon: remove tb_partners-etl-service-node_modules: volume is in use - [4f5b19eb4167334b999694b88818cfbe03397ae32f80747059fab97756400ec8]

$ docker container ls -a |grep etl

$ docker container rm partners-devtools_partners-etl-service_container

$ docker container stop partners-devtools_partners-etl-service_container
partners-devtools_partners-etl-service_container

$ docker container rm partners-devtools_partners-etl-service_container
partners-devtools_partners-etl-service_container

$ docker volume rm tb_partners-etl-service-node_modules
tb_partners-etl-service-node_modules
```

## Misleading error messages

### Failed to connect to localhost:1433 - Could not connect (sequence)

(Last updated: 2019/05/24)

If you see...

```

This is likely a false positive. 

MSSQL takes some time to boot, and there currently is no reasonable way to wait for it to be ready before starting other containers. 

All of the Node services depending on MSSQL (currently `legacy-database`, `legacy-bridge-cloud-service`, `legacy-bridge-manage-service`) [attempt to connect to MSSQL in a retry loop](https://github.com/TouchBistro/legacy-database/blob/c7431fb48cadff4cf397f0b2b9f672ba86f402a0/docker-entrypoint-db.sh).

It may actually be that MSSQL is down after all of this. In that case you would see the real error message:

```
Tried 10 times to connect to database and failed, terminating
```

This is also a false positive. Services depending on localstack have a [similar retry loop](https://github.com/TouchBistro/partners-etl-service/blob/develop/entrypoints/localstack-entrypoint.sh)

If it is a real error, it will say:

```
"Tried 10 times, but failed. Terminating...
```
